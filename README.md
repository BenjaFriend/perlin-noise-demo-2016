# perlin-noise-demo-2016

This is an old homework assignment(from RIT's IGME 202) that goes over using perlin noise to set the values of terrian in Unity. I cut out most of the peices of that homework to make this quicker demo. 

I use this as a beginners demo for the game dev club to explain noise to incoming members. It's good because it allows for a very visual representaion of noise right inside Unity, with direct control of what the different values do.
